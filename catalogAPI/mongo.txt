			subject:"Great Tablet!",
			body: "This is a full power, spec'd out PC 1st, which also happens to function nicely as a tablet. In fact, I no longer use any type of dedicated tablet, just this one device. I am a Surface Pro 3 user who loved the device enough to move up to the Surface Pro 4 (mostly for the higher specs and larger screen). This makes my opinion based on over a year with Surface Pro's, and a little biased since I clearly liked it enough to get another one.",
